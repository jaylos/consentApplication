**ACCOMPLISHMENT**

Created a webpage.

**GOAL**

Think of an easy and cost-efficient way to creat an MVP that can be tested.
May interview various college students before it is done.

** What does *Consent* do?**

The idea for this app is to create a comfortable platform for consent. 
The app will require the user to answer several quiz questions to test 
their capability to consent (whether they are not too drunk). If they 
pass the quiz, they will be prompted with the question of whether or not 
they consent. Each page of the quiz will have a button to send an automated 
text message to a trusted friend. If the trusted friend doesn’t respond within five minutes, a pre-recorded call with your friend will play. Additionally, each page will have a button that automatically fails the quiz. This feature gives the user an easy excuse to not consent rather than having to say “no.” The app would allow a university or subscriber to keep a log of consents. The idea is not to legally bound people to this, but to let users make educated choices. 

** Who are the customers? **

College and universities across the globe that struggle with and are burdended
by sexual misconduct.  


** What is their pain **

College campuses across the globe are forced to address and grapple with 
issues correlated with consent and the lack thereof. For example, research 
suggest that 18 percent of college students think that someone has 
consented as long as they don't say "no".

** Why will this application provide a solution to this pressing issue? **

This application provides the user with a way to get out of the situation 
in which they find themselves in. For example, if they fail the test, a text message is sent 
to their documented, "trusted friend". If the the friend does not respond within 5 minutes, 
the user gets an pre-recorded call of their saying that they have to go.


** Could this potentially be used by millions of people? Why do you think so? **

Yes, research suggest that many have trouble saying no.

** How do you imagine that you would support this venture? Is it non-profit? Is it for profit? **

The costs would be fairly minimal.For example,we will be doing all the programming. Further,  
the main cost, initially, will be hosting a website. Moreover, the application will obtain funding 
from the instiutions that invest in the application. 

**How will you reach these customers and convert them into users of your app?**

The application will reach customers through orientations such as those put on by Yale's
CCE (community health and consent educators) that clarify the concept of consent

** What are the biggest risks? **

Colleges and universities will not feel view the application as viable 
and a potential solution to issues correlated with consent and the lack thereof.

**Possible solutions to such risks**

Have a group of college students test out the application to prove that it is effective/ 

**How will the application be impactful?**

The unique features of the application, such as pre-recorded phone call and emergency text
messages to a trusted friend, provide the user with an easy way to leave and distance
themselves from a situation.

**How will the software function?**

The app will require the user to answer several quiz questions to test 
their capability to consent (whether they are not too drunk). If they 
pass the quiz, they will be prompted with the question of whether or not 
they consent. Each page of the quiz will have a button to send an automated 
text message to a trusted friend. If the trusted friend doesn’t respond within five minutes, a pre-recorded call with your friend will play. Additionally, each page will have a button that automatically fails the quiz. This feature gives the user an easy excuse to not consent rather than having to say “no.” The app would allow a university or subscriber to keep a log of consents. The idea is not to legally bound people to this, but to let users make educated choices. 



**Technical Stacks**

The front-end stack will be made up of HTML, CSS,
and Javascript.
